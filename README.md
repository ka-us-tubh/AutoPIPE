# AutoPIPE

AutoPIPE is a main project aimed at creating automated pipelines for integrating different apps, AI tools, and language models (LLM) together to create useful applications.
At its core, AutoPIPE leverages the power of automation to orchestrate complex workflows and enhance productivity across different domains. By automating repetitive tasks and orchestrating the flow of data and processes, AutoPIPE empowers developers and organizations to focus their efforts on higher-value activities, thereby accelerating the development cycle and reducing time-to-market.

Through the integration of different apps, AI tools, and language models, AutoPIPE enables the creation of sophisticated applications that leverage the strengths of each component. Whether it's harnessing the predictive capabilities of machine learning algorithms, the natural language processing capabilities of language models, or the functionality of existing applications, AutoPIPE provides a flexible and scalable infrastructure to support diverse use cases and applications.

# AutoPIPE: Targeted Marketing

AutoPIPE: Targeted Marketing is a sub-project aimed at automating the process of targeted marketing by utilizing LinkedIn data and ChatGPT to craft personalized messages for individuals.
